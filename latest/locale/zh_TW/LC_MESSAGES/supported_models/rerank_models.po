"SGLang offers comprehensive support for rerank models by incorporating "
"optimized serving frameworks with a flexible programming interface. This "
"setup enables efficient processing of cross-encoder reranking tasks, "
"improving the accuracy and relevance of search result ordering. SGLang’s "
"design ensures high throughput and low latency during reranker model "
"deployment, making it ideal for semantic-based result refinement in large-"
"scale retrieval systems."

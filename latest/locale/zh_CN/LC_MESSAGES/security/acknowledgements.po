"A security flaw exists in lmsys sglang versions ≥ 0.4.6 and ≤ 0.5.3. The "
"vulnerability arises from the use of unsafe pickle deserialization of the "
"`serialized_named_tensors` parameter in the `/update_weights_from_tensor` "
"API endpoint, which could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code "
"on the server by sending a specially crafted payload."

"R-Fork (Tensor Remote Fork) is a novel weight loading methodology that "
"leverages efficient inter-node GPU-to-GPU data transfer path to load tensors "
"from a running SGLang instance to a new instance with zero-copy. It can "
"significantly optimize the SGLang instance boot-up time by reducing model "
"weights loading from several minutes to mere seconds."

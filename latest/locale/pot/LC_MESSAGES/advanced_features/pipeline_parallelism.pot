"With chunked prefill, pipeline parallelism has the potential to reduce the "
"TTFT of long-context inputs. For each request, its input tokens can be "
"partitioned into multiple chunks, each no longer than the chunked prefill "
"size. Different chunks of the same request can be processed simultaneously "
"by different nodes, thus parallelizing the processing and reducing TTFT."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../advanced_features/pipeline_parallelism.md:7
msgid ""
"Also, pipeline parallelism only requires cross-node communication at the "
"boundaries of each pipeline stage, which can achieve better computation-"
"communication overlap compared to a large TP. Therefore, it is also a "
"promising parallelization strategy for improving throughput."

"SGLang has supported Pipeline Parallelism (#5724) for some time and made it "

"To reduce PP bubbles, SGLang now utilizes asynchronous sends for "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../advanced_features/pipeline_parallelism.md:17
msgid ""
"Chunked prefill with a fixed size can cause bubbles in the pipeline, "
"especially when the pp size is large. The main reason behind this phenomenon "
"is that the model has a non-uniform running time, even though each chunk "
"size is identical (brought by the Transformer structure). The larger the "
"prefix sequence length, the longer the running time of the chunk. And these "
"bubbles will be propagated to the next stage, and will significantly degrade "
"the scale efficiency of larger pp ranks."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../advanced_features/pipeline_parallelism.md:19
msgid ""
"To address this issue, we introduce a dynamic chunking mechanism and use a "
"quadratic function to fit this condition: Runtime(Prefix Sequence Length + "
"Next Chunk Size) - Runtime(Prefix Sequence Length) = Runtime(Initial Chunk "
"Size). Based on this method, we can dynamically reduce the chunk size to "
"minimize the bubbles caused by the stage misalignment."

msgid ""
"When `--enable-dynamic-chunking` is enabled, each chunk size of a sequence "
"is determined dynamically based on the quadratic model that predicts the "
"next chunk size based on the estimated runtime of the initial chunk length. "
"In this case, we use `--chunked-prefill-size` to set up the initial chunk "
"size. When switching to the dynamic chunking mode, the initial chunk size "
"(`--chunked-prefill-size`) should be set to a larger value comparable to the "
"original chunked prefill size, so that there won't be too many chunks."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../advanced_features/pipeline_parallelism.md:25
msgid ""
"**`SGLANG_DYNAMIC_CHUNKING_SMOOTH_FACTOR`** is a parameter that controls the "
"smoothing factor for the dynamic chunking algorithm, defaulting to 0.75. It "
"determines how much the chunk size can change during the prefill phase. A "
"larger value means a more aggressive chunk size change, which may lead to "
"better performance but also to greater chunk size changes (the chunk size at "
"the end may become very small, which could lead to performance degradation) "
"and more total chunks. When it is set to 1, the chunk size will be adjusted "
"strictly based on the aforementioned quadratic model that predicts the next "
"chunk size. A smaller value means a more conservative chunk size change, "
"which may lead to smaller chunk size changes and fewer total chunks. When it "
"is set to 0, the chunk size will not be adjusted dynamically, so it is "
"identical to the traditional way with a fixed chunked prefill size."

"Optimizing the chunked prefill size is crucial for balancing pipeline "
"efficiency and resource utilization. The ideal size depends on factors "
"including model architecture, hardware configuration, and typical input "
"lengths. We recommend starting with a small chunk size, such as 4K, and "
"gradually increasing it until you find the optimal size for your specific "
"use case. Alternatively, you can analyze the hardware capacity and determine "
"the optimal chunk size based on the roofline model."

"When evaluating pipeline parallelism with fixed chunked prefill sizes from "

"When enabling dynamic chunking, we first scale the optimal fixed chunked "
"prefill size by a factor of 3 as the initial chunk size. Through "
"experimentation, we found that a multiplier of 2-3 provides an appropriate "
"balance—avoiding excessive initial pipeline bubbles while ensuring that "
"subsequent chunks don't become too small as context length increases. With "
"the default dynamic chunking smoothing factor of 0.75, we performed "
"parameter tuning and determined that a value of 0.65 works optimally with "
"the 12K initial chunk size for the DeepSeek-V3.1, while a value of 0.8 works "

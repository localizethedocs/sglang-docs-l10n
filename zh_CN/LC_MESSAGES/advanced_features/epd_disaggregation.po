"In modern Vision-Language Model (VLM) inference, request execution naturally "
"decomposes into three distinct stages: Encoder, Prefill, and Decode. The "
"Encoder stage performs vision preprocessing and ViT-based image encoding, "
"which is highly compute-intensive but only required during request "
"initialization. The Prefill stage processes the full multimodal input "
"sequence to initialize the language model’s Key-Value (KV) cache, while the "
"Decode stage is dominated by memory bandwidth and KV cache access for "
"autoregressive token generation."

"Existing deployments typically colocate these stages within a unified "
"execution engine, or at best apply Prefill–Decode (PD) disaggregation. "
"However, such designs still tightly couple vision encoding with language "
"prefill, leading to inefficient resource utilization, limited scalability "
"for image-heavy workloads, and suboptimal scheduling under load."

#: ../../../advanced_features/epd_disaggregation.md:10
msgid ""
"To address these challenges, we introduce Encoder–Prefill–Decode (EPD) "
"Disaggregation in SGLang. EPD further separates vision encoding from "
"language processing, enabling independent horizontal scaling of encoder "
"servers, improved load balancing for multimodal requests, and seamless "
"integration with existing PD disaggregation to form a fully decoupled three-"
"tier inference architecture."

msgid ""
"You can launch a language-only model using `--language-only`, or an encoder-"
"only model using `--encoder-only`. When launching a language-only model, you "
"must additionally specify the encoder service endpoints via `--encoder-urls`."

"We support multiple encoder transfer backends, including zmq_to_scheduler, "
"zmq_to_tokenizer, and mooncake (the default is zmq_to_scheduler). The "
"backend can be selected using `--encoder-transfer-backend`."

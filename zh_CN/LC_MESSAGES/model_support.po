"To support a new model in SGLang, you only need to add a single file under "
"[SGLang Models Directory](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/tree/main/"
"python/sglang/srt/models). You can learn from existing model implementations "
"and create new files for the new models. Most models are based on the "
"transformer architecture, making them very similar."

"Another valuable resource is the [vLLM Models Directory](https://github.com/"
"vllm-project/vllm/tree/main/vllm/model_executor/models). vLLM has extensive "
"coverage of models, and SGLang has reused vLLM for most parts of the model "
"implementations. This similarity makes it easy to port many models from vLLM "
"to SGLang."

"To port a model from vLLM to SGLang, you can compare these two files [SGLang "
"LLaMA Implementation](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/python/"
"sglang/srt/models/llama2.py) and [vLLM LLaMA Implementation](https://github."
"com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/main/vllm/model_executor/models/llama.py). This "
"comparison will help you understand how to convert a model implementation "
"from vLLM to SGLang. The major difference is the replacement of "
"PagedAttention with RadixAttention. The other parts are almost identical. "
"Specifically,"

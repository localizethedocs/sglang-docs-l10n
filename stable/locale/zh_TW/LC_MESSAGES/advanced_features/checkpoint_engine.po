"The SGLang checkpoint engine integration provides an efficient way to load "
"model weights using a distributed checkpoint loading system. This feature "
"significantly reduces model loading time, especially for large models and "
"multi-node setups, by parallelizing the weight loading process across "
"multiple processes and nodes."

"If OOM occurs during prefill, try reducing `--chunked-prefill-size` to "
"`4096` or `2048`. This saves memory but slows down the prefill speed for "
"long prompts."

"You can also reduce `--mem-fraction-static` to a smaller value, such as 0.8 "
"or 0.7. This decreases the memory usage of the KV cache memory pool and "
"helps prevent OOM errors during both prefill and decoding. However, it "
"limits maximum concurrency and reduces peak throughput."

"Another common case for OOM is requesting input logprobs for a long prompt "
"as it requires significant memory. To address this, set `logprob_start_len` "
"in your sampling parameters to include only the necessary parts. If you do "
"need input logprobs for a long prompt, try reducing `--mem-fraction-static`."

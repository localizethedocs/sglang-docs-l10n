"SGLang is a fast serving framework for large language models and vision "
"language models. It makes your interaction with models faster and more "
"controllable by co-designing the backend runtime and frontend language. The "
"core features include:"

"**Fast Backend Runtime**: Provides efficient serving with RadixAttention for "
"prefix caching, zero-overhead CPU scheduler, prefill-decode disaggregation, "
"speculative decoding, continuous batching, paged attention, tensor "
"parallelism, pipeline parallelism, expert parallelism, structured outputs, "
"chunked prefill, quantization (FP8/INT4/AWQ/GPTQ), and multi-lora batching."

"**Flexible Frontend Language**: Offers an intuitive interface for "
"programming LLM applications, including chained generation calls, advanced "
"prompting, control flow, multi-modal inputs, parallelism, and external "
"interactions."

"**Extensive Model Support**: Supports a wide range of generative models "
"(Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, LLaVA, etc.), embedding models (e5-"
"mistral, gte, mcdse) and reward models (Skywork), with easy extensibility "
"for integrating new models."

"From our initial investigation, this indeterminism arises from two factors: "
"dynamic batching and prefix caching. Roughly speaking, dynamic batching "
"accounts for about 95% of the indeterminism, while prefix caching accounts "
"for the remaining portion. The server runs dynamic batching under the hood. "
"Different batch sizes can cause PyTorch/CuBLAS to dispatch to different CUDA "
"kernels, which can lead to slight numerical differences. This difference "
"accumulates across many layers, resulting in nondeterministic output when "
"the batch size changes. Similarly, when prefix caching is enabled, it can "
"also dispatch to different kernels. Even when the computations are "
"mathematically equivalent, small numerical differences from different kernel "
"implementations lead to the final nondeterministic outputs."

"To achieve more deterministic outputs in the current code, you can add `--"
"disable-radix-cache` and send only one request at a time. The results will "
"be mostly deterministic under this setting."

"We are still investigating the root causes and potential solutions. In the "
"short term, we may introduce a \"deterministic mode\" that uses more padding "
"to address the variance caused by dynamic batching. This mode will be more "
"deterministic but slower."

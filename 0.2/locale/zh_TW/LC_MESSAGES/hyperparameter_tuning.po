"`#queue-req` indicates the number of requests in the queue. If you "
"frequently see `#queue-req == 0`, it suggests you are bottlenecked by the "
"request submission speed. A healthy range for `#queue-req` is `50 - 1000`. "
"On the other hand, do not make `#queue-req` too large because it will also "
"increase the scheduling overhead on the server."

"`token usage` indicates the KV cache memory utilization of the server. "
"`token usage > 0.9` means good utilization. If you frequently see `token "
"usage < 0.9` and `#queue-req > 0`, it means the server is too conservative "
"about taking in new requests. You can decrease `--schedule-conservativeness` "
"to a value like 0.3. The case of serving being too conservative can happen "
"when users send many requests with a large `max_new_tokens` but the requests "
"stop very early due to EOS or stop strings."

"On the other hand, if you see `token usage` very high and you frequently see "
"warnings like `decode out of memory happened, #retracted_reqs: 1, "
"#new_token_ratio: 0.9998 -> 1.0000`, you can increase `--schedule-"
"conservativeness` to a value like 1.3. If you see `decode out of memory "
"happened` occasionally but not frequently, it is okay."

"If you see out of memory (OOM) errors, you can decrease these parameters.   "

"`4096` or `2048`.   If OOM happens during decoding, try to decrease `--max-"
"running-requests`.   You can also try to decrease `--mem-fraction-static`, "
"which reduces the memory usage of the KV cache memory pool and helps both "
"prefill and decoding."
